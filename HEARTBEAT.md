# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Check-in

When you receive a heartbeat, check these items. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

## Checklist

1. **Memory maintenance** - Are there unsaved notes from recent sessions? Save them.
2. **Pending tasks** - Anything the user asked for that's still incomplete?
3. **Reminders** - Any upcoming deadlines or scheduled events?

## Context Window Check

If context window is >50% full:
1. Update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with current session activity
2. Update `memory/KEY-DECISIONS.md` if any new decisions made

_Customize this checklist based on what matters to your human._
